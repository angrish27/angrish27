## What this is
A URL shortener service built on **.NET 10** using an **IDesign-style layered architecture**
(Clients → Managers → Engines → Accessors, with Utilities and Common as cross-cutting layers).
The URL shortener feature (`ProcessUrlController` -> `UrlManager` -> `UrlValidationEngine` / `UrlMappingAccessor` / `ShortCodeUtility`)
is the reference vertical slice for all new features.

## Key facts (quick reference)
- Target framework: `net10.0`; `Nullable=disable`; `ImplicitUsings=disable`; `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`.
- All services implement `IService`, are `internal sealed`, have a parameterless constructor and are created **only through factories**.
- Per-request `AmbientContext` (CorrelationId, UserId, Claims) flows through every factory/service.
- Correlation header: `x-correlation-id`. Health endpoint: `/health`.
- Test framework: **MSTest**. Shared test base: `CS.AgenticUrlShortner.Shared.Tests.TestBase`.
- IaC: **Pulumi (azure-native, C#)** → Resource Group, Log Analytics, App Insights, Linux App Service Plan, Web App.

## Glossary
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Manager | Orchestrates a use case; the only layer Clients may call |
| Engine | Pure business logic/validation; no I/O of its own |
| Accessor | Encapsulates data stores and external resources |
| Utility | Cross-cutting stateless helper callable from any layer |
| AmbientContext | Request-scoped caller/correlation data |
