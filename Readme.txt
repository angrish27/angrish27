Agentic URL Shortener
=====================

A .NET Web API that turns valid long URLs into short links and redirects short links to their original destinations. The service persists URL mappings in a JSON file and exposes a health-check endpoint.

What this repository does
-------------------------

- POST /api/url/encode validates a URL and returns a short URL. A newly stored URL returns 201 Created; submitting the same URL again returns 200 OK with the existing short URL.
- GET /{code} redirects to the original URL with 302 Found. Unknown or invalid codes return 404 Not Found.
- New short codes are URL-safe Base64 encodings of the request-received Unix epoch timestamp in nanoseconds. The store advances timestamps monotonically to avoid collisions when requests arrive within the same system-clock tick. Legacy Base62 links remain supported.
- Mappings are stored in App_Data/url-mappings.json by default.
- The API also provides GET /health.

The API accepts absolute HTTP or HTTPS URLs up to 2,048 characters. It rejects malformed URLs and URLs that point back to the shortener service. The encode endpoint has an 8 KB request-body limit and a default rate limit of 30 requests per minute per process.

Tech used
---------

- C# and .NET 10
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- MSTest for unit and HTTP integration tests
- JSON-file persistence behind a storage interface
- Pulumi with the Azure Native provider for the infrastructure project

Agentic AI development
----------------------

This project uses AI coding agents as active participants in software development, not just for one-off code suggestions. Repository guidance gives agents the architecture and conventions they need to plan a task, implement changes across the appropriate layers, run tests, iterate on failures, and report their results. A human reviews and approves changes before they are merged.

The workflow is defined in the root AGENTS.md, with detailed architecture and coding guidance in AgentUrlShortner/docs/agent-instructions.md. See AgentUrlShortner/docs/agentic-development-example.md for a sample task and its test report. The API itself remains a conventional URL shortener; it does not require AI to run.

IDesign approach
----------------

The backend follows an IDesign Method-style, volatility-based layered architecture. Requests flow through:

    Client (Web API) -> Manager -> Engine -> Accessor
                             \-> Utilities and Common are shared across layers

- Clients expose HTTP endpoints and handle HTTP-specific concerns.
- Managers orchestrate use cases.
- Engines contain business rules and validation.
- Accessors handle persistence and external resources.
- Utilities provide stateless helpers; Common contains shared infrastructure such as factories, context, constants, and exceptions.
- Contracts define client-facing DTOs and internal logic models; Tests cover the layers and API.

Dependencies flow down the layers: clients call managers, and lower layers do not call back into higher layers. See AgentUrlShortner/docs/architecture.md for the detailed dependency rules.

How to set up
-------------

Prerequisites:

- .NET 10 SDK
- Git

Run the API locally from the repository root:

    dotnet dev-certs https --trust
    dotnet run --project "AgentUrlShortner/Backend/1. Clients/CS.AgenticUrlShortner.WebApiClient/CS.AgenticUrlShortner.WebApiClient.csproj"

The development launch profile listens at:

- HTTPS: https://localhost:7181
- HTTP: http://localhost:5181 (redirects to HTTPS)

Check that the API is healthy at https://localhost:7181/health. The default data file is created when the first URL is encoded, under the API content root. Ensure that directory is writable. The default JSON-file store and its in-process locking are intended for a single running instance; see AgentUrlShortner/docs/decisions.md.

Build and test from the repository root:

    dotnet build AgentUrlShortner/Backend/CS.AgenticUrlShortner.sln
    dotnet test AgentUrlShortner/Backend/CS.AgenticUrlShortner.sln

The test suite uses MSTest and includes API integration tests. See AgentUrlShortner/docs/testing.md for test projects and conventions.

Sample request and expected response
------------------------------------

Send a POST request to:

    https://localhost:7181/api/url/encode

Set Content-Type: application/json and use this JSON body:

    {
      "longUrl": "https://example.com/my-page"
    }

For example, with curl:

    curl -i -X POST "https://localhost:7181/api/url/encode" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"longUrl":"https://example.com/my-page"}'

For a new URL, expect 201 Created, a Location header containing the short URL, and a response body like:

    {
      "shortUrl": "https://localhost:7181/<generated-epoch-token>"
    }

The generated token is an 11-character, URL-safe Base64 value and varies with request time and existing mappings. Repeating the same request returns 200 OK and the existing short URL. Opening that URL redirects to the original URL. Existing mappings stored with the older Base62 format continue to work.

For Postman, choose POST, enter the endpoint URL, then select Body -> raw -> JSON and paste the request body above. If Postman reports a certificate error with the local HTTPS endpoint, trust the .NET development certificate using the setup command above.
